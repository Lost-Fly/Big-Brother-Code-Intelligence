algorithmSkills: The base level involves knowledge of fundamental data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, stacks, queues) and simple sorting and searching algorithms. The intermediate level includes understanding more complex algorithms, such as merge sort, quicksort, graph algorithms (depth-first and breadth-first search), and dynamic programming. The advanced level is characterized by the ability to develop and optimize custom algorithms to solve complex problems, analyze time and space complexity, and apply advanced algorithmic concepts to enhance the efficiency of software solutions.
dbSkills: The basic level includes an understanding of relational database fundamentals, performing basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete), and writing simple SQL queries. The intermediate level involves knowledge of data normalization, complex SQL queries with joins, subqueries, and indexing for performance optimization. The advanced level encompasses a deep understanding of database architecture, transaction management, setting up replication and sharding, as well as optimizing queries and data schemas to ensure high performance and scalability of systems.
brokerSkills: The base level entails understanding the principles of message brokers, such as RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka, and the ability to create and manage simple queues or topics for message transmission between services. The intermediate level includes configuring message routing, managing acknowledgments and retries, and ensuring system reliability and resilience in case of failures. The advanced level is characterized by designing and implementing scalable and distributed systems based on message brokers, optimizing performance, integrating with various services, and ensuring the security of data transmission.
