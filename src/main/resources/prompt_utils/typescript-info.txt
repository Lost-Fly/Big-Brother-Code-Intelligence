generics_and_advanced_types: The base level includes understanding the basics of generics and simple type constructs in TypeScript. Intermediate developers can effectively utilize advanced type features such as bounded generics and type parameters to create reusable and flexible components. Advanced developers demonstrate mastery by implementing complex generic patterns, ensuring type safety, and enhancing scalability in large-scale TypeScript applications.
type_system_mastery: Beginners have a fundamental grasp of TypeScript's type system, including primitive and composite types. Intermediate developers understand and apply more sophisticated type system features, such as interfaces, type aliases, and type hierarchies. Advanced mastery involves deep expertise in leveraging the type system to design robust, scalable architectures, enforce strict type safety across the codebase, and utilize advanced features like declaration merging and module augmentation.
type_inference: At the basic level, developers recognize and utilize TypeScript's type inference capabilities for simple variables and expressions. Intermediate proficiency includes effectively relying on type inference in more complex scenarios, such as function return types and generics. Advanced users optimize type inference to reduce boilerplate, enhance code readability, and maintain type safety in intricate code structures.
union_and_intersection_types: Beginners understand the concept of union types for variables that can hold multiple types. Intermediate developers use union and intersection types to create more flexible and reusable type definitions. Advanced proficiency involves leveraging these types to model complex data structures and behaviors, ensuring comprehensive type safety and enabling sophisticated type manipulations.
decorators_usage: The base level involves knowing the syntax of decorators and applying standard decorators to classes and methods. Intermediate developers create custom decorators, manage their interactions with class properties and methods, and use decorators for aspects like logging or access control. Advanced users develop complex decorators, handle metadata, integrate decorators within design patterns, and combine them with other advanced TypeScript features to enhance code modularity and reusability.
declaration_merging: Beginners are aware of basic declaration merging concepts, such as combining interfaces or types in TypeScript. Intermediate developers utilize declaration merging to extend existing types and interfaces effectively. Advanced mastery includes sophisticated use of declaration merging to augment third-party libraries, manage complex type extensions, and maintain type consistency across large projects.
conditional_types: At the basic level, developers understand simple conditional types for basic type transformations. Intermediate proficiency involves using conditional types for more dynamic type definitions and type manipulations based on certain conditions. Advanced users design intricate conditional types to create highly adaptable and type-safe APIs, enabling advanced type-level programming techniques.
mapped_types: Beginners grasp the concept of mapped types for transforming existing types into new ones. Intermediate developers apply mapped types to create flexible and reusable type transformations across different parts of the codebase. Advanced proficiency includes designing complex mapped types to enforce consistent type patterns, automate type generation, and enhance the scalability of type definitions in large TypeScript applications.
