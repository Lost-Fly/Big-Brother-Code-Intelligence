bash_scripting_basics: The basic level includes understanding fundamental bash scripting concepts such as creating and executing simple scripts, using shebang (#!) lines, and making scripts executable. Intermediate developers can write more complex scripts involving loops, conditionals, and basic text processing. Advanced users demonstrate the ability to create robust, efficient scripts that handle various edge cases, utilize advanced bash features, and integrate with other system tools and utilities.
variable_manipulation: At the basic level, developers can declare, assign, and reference variables in bash scripts. Intermediate proficiency includes performing variable operations such as concatenation, substitution, and arithmetic operations. Advanced users are adept at using indirect references, manipulating arrays and associative arrays, and employing parameter expansion techniques to create dynamic and flexible scripts.
control_structures: Beginners understand and implement basic control structures like if statements, for loops, and while loops to control the flow of scripts. Intermediate developers can utilize more complex structures, including nested loops, case statements, and conditional expressions. Advanced proficiency involves designing intricate control flows, optimizing loops for performance, and implementing advanced conditional logic to handle complex scripting scenarios.
command_substitution: The basic level involves using command substitution to capture the output of commands and assign it to variables using backticks (`) or the $(...) syntax. Intermediate developers effectively integrate command substitution within scripts to streamline operations and enhance script functionality. Advanced users leverage command substitution in combination with other scripting techniques to create powerful, efficient, and maintainable scripts that dynamically interact with system commands and utilities.
input_and_output_redirection: At the basic level, developers can redirect standard input and output using operators like >, <, and >>. Intermediate proficiency includes using more advanced redirection techniques such as piping (|), redirecting standard error (2>), and combining multiple redirections. Advanced users master complex redirection scenarios, including here-documents, process substitution, and managing file descriptors to create sophisticated and flexible script workflows.
function_definitions: Beginners can define and call simple functions within bash scripts to organize code and reuse functionality. Intermediate developers create functions with parameters, local variables, and return values, enhancing script modularity and readability. Advanced users design complex functions that incorporate error handling, recursion, and integration with other functions and scripts, enabling the development of large-scale, maintainable bash applications.
error_handling_and_exit_codes: The basic level involves understanding and using exit codes to indicate the success or failure of commands and scripts. Intermediate proficiency includes implementing error checking using conditional statements and handling common errors gracefully. Advanced users develop comprehensive error handling strategies, utilize traps for catching signals and errors, and create robust scripts that can recover from failures and provide meaningful error messages to users.
string_and_array_operations: At the basic level, developers can perform simple string manipulations and handle basic arrays in bash scripts. Intermediate developers utilize advanced string operations such as pattern matching, substitution, and extraction, as well as manage indexed and associative arrays effectively. Advanced proficiency includes performing complex string parsing, manipulating multi-dimensional arrays, and integrating string and array operations to handle intricate data processing tasks within scripts.
process_substitution: Beginners are aware of process substitution and can use it in simple scenarios to redirect the output of a process as if it were a file. Intermediate developers effectively integrate process substitution into scripts to streamline workflows and handle complex data streams. Advanced users leverage process substitution to create highly efficient and sophisticated scripts that perform parallel processing, inter-process communication, and dynamic data handling in complex scripting environments.
using_bash_builtin_commands: The basic level includes familiarity with common bash built-in commands such as echo, cd, pwd, and export. Intermediate developers utilize a broader range of built-in commands and understand their options and behaviors to optimize script performance. Advanced users have in-depth knowledge of bash built-ins, including less commonly used commands, and can leverage them to write highly efficient, secure, and maintainable scripts, minimizing the need for external command dependencies.
