object_oriented_programming: The basic level includes understanding fundamental OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Intermediate developers can design and implement complex class hierarchies, utilize access specifiers effectively, and apply design principles like SOLID. Advanced users demonstrate mastery by architecting scalable systems using advanced OOP patterns, ensuring code reusability and maintainability, and leveraging OOP to solve complex design challenges.
template_programming: At the basic level, developers grasp the syntax and usage of simple templates for functions and classes. Intermediate proficiency includes creating and utilizing template specializations, understanding template parameter deduction, and implementing generic programming techniques. Advanced users excel in designing complex template metaprogramming solutions, optimizing compile-time computations, and utilizing advanced features like variadic templates and template constraints to build highly flexible and efficient C++ libraries and applications.
memory_management_with_pointers: Beginners understand basic pointer operations, including declaration, initialization, dereferencing, and simple pointer arithmetic. Intermediate developers effectively manage dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using new and delete, handle pointers to complex data structures, and avoid common pitfalls like dangling pointers and memory leaks. Advanced users demonstrate expertise in smart pointers (e.g., std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr), implement custom memory management strategies, and optimize memory usage for high-performance and resource-constrained applications.
understanding_standard_template_library: The basic level includes familiarity with fundamental STL components such as vectors, lists, maps, and basic algorithms like sort and find. Intermediate proficiency involves leveraging more complex STL features, including iterators, lambda expressions, and advanced algorithms for efficient data manipulation. Advanced users possess deep knowledge of the entire STL, can customize and extend STL components, optimize their usage for performance-critical applications, and contribute to the development of custom containers and algorithms that integrate seamlessly with the STL framework.
move_semantics_and_rvalue_references: At the basic level, developers understand the concepts of lvalues and rvalues and can implement simple move constructors and move assignment operators. Intermediate proficiency includes effectively using std::move, understanding the implications of move semantics on resource management, and optimizing code to minimize unnecessary copies. Advanced users master the intricacies of move semantics, design classes that fully leverage rvalue references for maximum efficiency, and apply these concepts to develop high-performance, resource-efficient applications.
exception_safety: Beginners are aware of basic exception handling using try, catch, and throw constructs to manage runtime errors. Intermediate developers implement robust error handling strategies, ensure resource cleanup with RAII, and write exception-safe code that maintains program stability. Advanced users design comprehensive exception safety guarantees (basic, strong, and no-throw), integrate exception handling seamlessly into large codebases, and utilize advanced techniques to prevent and manage exceptions in multi-threaded and complex systems.
multiple_inheritance: The basic level involves understanding the syntax and basic use cases of multiple inheritance in C++. Intermediate proficiency includes managing the complexities of multiple inheritance, such as the diamond problem, and effectively using virtual inheritance to resolve ambiguities. Advanced users skillfully design class hierarchies that leverage multiple inheritance for code reuse and flexibility, implement interfaces using abstract base classes, and ensure maintainability and clarity in complex inheritance structures.
virtual_functions: Beginners understand the concept of virtual functions and how to declare and override them in derived classes. Intermediate developers utilize virtual functions to achieve polymorphic behavior, implement abstract classes and interfaces, and manage virtual tables effectively. Advanced users demonstrate expertise in designing and optimizing polymorphic systems, understand the performance implications of virtual functions, and employ advanced techniques like pure virtual functions and virtual destructors to create flexible and extensible software architectures.
