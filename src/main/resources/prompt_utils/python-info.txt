experience_writing_tests: The basic level includes understanding fundamental testing concepts, writing simple unit tests, and using testing frameworks like unittest or pytest. Intermediate developers can implement more comprehensive test suites, use mocks and fixtures, and apply test-driven development (TDD) practices. Advanced users design extensive testing strategies, write integration and functional tests, implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, and ensure high code coverage and quality in complex applications.
experience_with_orm_sql: The basic level involves understanding object-relational mapping (ORM) basics, such as creating simple models and performing CRUD operations. Intermediate proficiency includes optimizing queries, handling complex relationships, and managing migrations. Advanced users design efficient and scalable database schemas, write complex SQL queries, optimize ORM performance, and ensure data integrity and consistency in applications through advanced ORM and SQL techniques.
knowledge_of_logging: The basic level includes setting up logging in applications, using log levels, and writing basic logs to track application behavior. Intermediate developers can configure different logging handlers, set up structured logging, and manage logs for debugging and monitoring purposes. Advanced users implement comprehensive logging systems, integrate logging with external monitoring tools, analyze logs for performance insights, and ensure secure, consistent logging practices across applications.
experience_async_code: The basic level includes understanding asynchronous programming fundamentals, including using async and await keywords to write non-blocking code. Intermediate proficiency involves managing asynchronous tasks, handling concurrency, and using libraries like asyncio. Advanced users design high-performance asynchronous systems, optimize concurrency for scalable applications, manage thread and task lifecycles effectively, and ensure safe, efficient handling of asynchronous operations in complex workflows.
decorators_usage: The basic level involves understanding and using basic decorators to modify function behavior. Intermediate developers can write custom decorators to implement reusable logic, such as logging and access control. Advanced users leverage decorators to create complex functionality, design and use decorator factories, apply decorators at scale in frameworks or libraries, and optimize decorator use for maintainability and flexibility in large applications.
context_managers: The basic level includes understanding the purpose of context managers, particularly in managing resources like file handling with with statements. Intermediate developers can create custom context managers using the __enter__ and __exit__ methods, handle resources beyond files, and use context managers for database connections or locks. Advanced users design complex and reusable context managers, optimize resource management for performance and safety, and apply context management principles to various components in resource-intensive applications.
generators: The basic level includes understanding how to create simple generators with yield for generating sequences and iterating over data lazily. Intermediate developers use generators for memory-efficient data handling, apply generator expressions, and chain multiple generators for complex data processing tasks. Advanced users design and implement complex generator-based pipelines, optimize data streaming, handle generator state and exceptions, and ensure high efficiency in handling large datasets.
external_apis: The basic level involves using libraries like requests to interact with external APIs, understanding HTTP methods, and handling simple API responses. Intermediate proficiency includes managing API authentication, handling rate limiting, and processing data from APIs in complex workflows. Advanced users design and implement robust API integration strategies, handle multiple and complex API endpoints, manage error handling and retries, and optimize API requests for efficiency and reliability in high-load applications.
