language_syntax_knowledge: A fundamental understanding of the syntax and basic programming constructs such as variables, data types, control structures (loops, conditionals), and functions is essential. This foundational knowledge allows developers to write correct and efficient code, regardless of the programming language. Proficiency in these basics ensures that developers can quickly adapt to new languages and frameworks by leveraging their core programming skills.
code_optimization: Writing code that runs efficiently by optimizing algorithms and resource usage, ensuring that applications perform well under various conditions without unnecessary consumption of resources.
consistent_naming_conventions: Using clear and consistent names for variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers, improving code readability and making it easier for developers to understand and navigate the codebase.
